    <p class="description">
        Green papaya salad is a spicy salad made from shredded unripe papaya. 
        It was created by the Lao people and is a popular national dish of Laos. 
        It also has become popular in Thailand and rest of the continental Southeast Asia (Cambodia, 
        Myanmar, and Vietnam), as well as Xishuangbanna (from China).

    <p class="description">
        Som tam, the Thai version of green papaya salad, was included on
         CNN on their list of the World's 50 most delicious foods. When done well, it's my personal favorite dish in the world!

    </p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <p class="steps">

        <ol>

            <li>
                Drain the soaked papaya well and place in a bowl lined with 2 layers of paper towel to absorb excess water. 
                You want to have as little water on the papaya as possible so as to not dilute the dressing.
            </li>

            <li>
                In a large mortar and pestle, pound garlic and chilies until there are no more big 
                chunks (pieces of chili skin are fine).
            </li>

            <li>
                Add palm sugar and mash with the pestle 
                until it turns into a wet paste and all the chunks are dissolved.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add long beans and pound just until they're broken.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add dried shrimp and peanuts and pound to break the peanuts up slightly.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add fish sauce, tamarind juice, and lime juice, adding the squeezed lime skin into the mortar 
                as well for extra lime fragrance. 
                Stir with a large spoon to mix and dissolve the sugar.
            </li>

            <li>
                Add shredded papaya and tomatoes, and mix using the pound-and-flip method. 
                Once everything looks well mixed and the tomatoes are just slightly crushed, it's done!
            </li>

            <li>
                Plate and sprinkle with the remaining peanuts
            </li>

            <li>
