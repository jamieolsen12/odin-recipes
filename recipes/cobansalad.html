    <p class="description">
        Ã‡oban salatasÄ± or choban salad (Turkish for "shepherd's salad") is a salad that originated from 
        Turkish cuisine and Azerbaijani cuisine consisting of finely chopped tomatoes (preferably peeled),
         cucumbers, long green peppers, onion, and flat-leaf parsley.
        The dressing consists of lemon juice, olive oil, and salt. It is a very popular summer dish 
        and is one of my favorite dishes. It can be eaten with almost any meal.
